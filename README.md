# ITians Website
Visit [here](http://itians.cf)  

This is our class website which we use to see our timetable and post notes. Last semester only I was managing the code but from this semester I have made it open source. Anybody from the class is encouraged to fork this repository, open issues and submit pull requests.

## Understanding the code
Do it yourself! (Just Kidding)  

This site uses [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com)  

For now, the code is pretty simple and has been commented. It is a nice place to start for absolute beginners. Still if you feel lost, contact me.
